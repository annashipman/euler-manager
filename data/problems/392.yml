  graph paper.\n\nConsider rectilinear grids in the Cartesian coordinate system with
  the following properties:\n\n- The gridlines are parallel to the axes of the Cartesian
  coordinate system.\n- There are N+2 vertical and N+2 horizontal gridlines. Hence
  there are (N+1) x (N+1) rectangular cells.\n- The equations of the two outer vertical
  gridlines are x = -1 and x = 1.\n- The equations of the two outer horizontal gridlines
  are y = -1 and y = 1.\n- The grid cells are colored red if they overlap with the
  <dfn title=\"The unit circle is the circle that has radius 1 and is centered at
  the origin\">unit circle</dfn>, black otherwise.\nFor this problem we would like
  you to find the positions of the remaining N inner horizontal and N inner vertical
  gridlines so that the area occupied by the red cells is minimized.\n\nE.g. here
  is a picture of the solution for N = 10:\n\n![p392_gridlines.png]({{ images_dir

  to 10 digits behind the decimal point is 3.3469640797.\n\nFind the positions for
  N = 400.  \n Give as your answer the area occupied by the red cells rounded to 10
  digits behind the decimal point.\n\n"
