:content: "Three distinct points are plotted at random on a Cartesian plane, for which
  -1000 ≤ _x_, _y_ ≤ 1000, such that a triangle is formed.\n\nConsider the following
  two triangles:\n\nA(-340,495), B(-153,-910), C(835,-947)  \n  \nX(-175,41), Y(-421,-714),
  Z(574,-645)\n\nIt can be verified that triangle ABC contains the origin, whereas
  triangle XYZ does not.\n\nUsing [triangles.txt](project/resources/p102_triangles.txt)
  (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 27K text file containing the co-ordinates
  of one thousand \"random\" triangles, find the number of triangles for which the
  interior contains the origin.\n\nNOTE: The first two examples in the file represent
  the triangles in the example given above.\n\n"
