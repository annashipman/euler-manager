:url: https://projecteuler.net/problem=46
:content: "It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can
  be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.\n\n9 = 7 + 2×1<sup>2</sup>
  \ \n15 = 7 + 2×2<sup>2</sup>  \n21 = 3 + 2×3<sup>2</sup>  \n25 = 7 + 2×3<sup>2</sup>
  \ \n27 = 19 + 2×2<sup>2</sup>  \n33 = 31 + 2×1<sup>2</sup>\n\nIt turns out that
  the conjecture was false.\n\nWhat is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written
  as the sum of a prime and twice a square?\n\n"
