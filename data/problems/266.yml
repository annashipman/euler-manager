:content: "The divisors of 12 are: 1,2,3,4,6 and 12.  \nThe largest divisor of 12
  that does not exceed the square root of 12 is 3.  \nWe shall call the largest divisor
  of an integer <var>n</var> that does not exceed the square root of <var>n</var>
  the pseudo square root (PSR) of <var>n</var>.  \nIt can be seen that PSR(3102)=47.\n\nLet
  <var>p</var> be the product of the primes below 190.  \nFind PSR(<var>p</var>) mod
  10<sup>16</sup>.\n\n"
