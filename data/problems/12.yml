:content: "The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers.
  So the 7<sup>th</sup> triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The
  first ten terms would be:\n\n1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...\n\nLet us
  list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:\n\n> **&nbsp;1** : 1  \n>
  **&nbsp;3** : 1,3  \n> **&nbsp;6** : 1,2,3,6  \n> **10** : 1,2,5,10  \n> **15**
  : 1,3,5,15  \n> **21** : 1,3,7,21  \n> **28** : 1,2,4,7,14,28\n\nWe can see that
  28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.\n\nWhat is the value
  of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?\n\n"
