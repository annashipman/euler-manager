:content: "Oregon licence plates consist of three letters followed by a three digit
  number (each digit can be from [0..9]).  \nWhile driving to work Seth plays the
  following game:  \nWhenever the numbers of two licence plates seen on his trip add
  to 1000 that's a win.\n\nE.g. MIC-012 and HAN-988 is a win and RYU-500 and SET-500
  too. (as long as he sees them in the same trip).\n\nFind the expected number of
  plates he needs to see for a win.  \nGive your answer rounded to 8 decimal places
  behind the decimal point.\n\n**Note:** We assume that each licence plate seen is
  equally likely to have any three digit number on it.\n\n"
