:content: "Here are the records from a busy telephone system with one million users:\n\n|
  RecNr | Caller | Called |\n| 1 | 200007 | 100053 |\n| 2 | 600183 | 500439 |\n| 3
  | 600863 | 701497 |\n| ... | ... | ... |\n\nThe telephone number of the caller and
  the called number in record n are Caller(n) = S<sub>2n-1</sub> and Called(n) = S<sub>2n</sub>
  where S<sub>1,2,3,...</sub> come from the \"Lagged Fibonacci Generator\":\n\nFor
  1 ≤ k ≤ 55, S<sub>k</sub> = [100003 - 200003k + 300007k<sup>3</sup>] (modulo 1000000)
  \ \nFor 56 ≤ k, S<sub>k</sub> = [S<sub>k-24</sub> + S<sub>k-55</sub>] (modulo 1000000)\n\nIf
  Caller(n) = Called(n) then the user is assumed to have misdialled and the call fails;
  otherwise the call is successful.\n\nFrom the start of the records, we say that
  any pair of users X and Y are friends if X calls Y or vice-versa. Similarly, X is
  a friend of a friend of Z if X is a friend of Y and Y is a friend of Z; and so on
  for longer chains.\n\nThe Prime Minister's phone number is 524287. After how many
  successful calls, not counting misdials, will 99% of the users (including the PM)
  be a friend, or a friend of a friend etc., of the Prime Minister?\n\n"
