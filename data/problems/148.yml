  We can easily verify that none of the entries in the first seven rows of Pascal's triangle are divisible by 7:

  | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp;1 |
  | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp;1 | &nbsp; | &nbsp;1 |
  | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp;1 | &nbsp; | &nbsp;2 | &nbsp; | &nbsp;1 |
  | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp;1 | &nbsp; | &nbsp;3 | &nbsp; | &nbsp;3 | &nbsp; | &nbsp;1 |
  | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp;1 | &nbsp; | &nbsp;4 | &nbsp; | &nbsp;6 | &nbsp; | &nbsp;4 | &nbsp; | &nbsp;1 |
  | &nbsp; | &nbsp;1 | &nbsp; | &nbsp;5 | &nbsp; | 10 | &nbsp; | 10 | &nbsp; | &nbsp;5 | &nbsp; | &nbsp;1 |
  | 1 | &nbsp; | &nbsp;6 | &nbsp; | 15 | &nbsp; | 20 | &nbsp; | 15 | &nbsp; | &nbsp;6 | &nbsp; | &nbsp;1 |

  However, if we check the first one hundred rows, we will find that only 2361 of the 5050 entries are _not_ divisible by 7.

  Find the number of entries which are _not_ divisible by 7 in the first one billion (10<sup>9</sup>) rows of Pascal's triangle.
