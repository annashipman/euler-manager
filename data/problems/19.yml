:content: "You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some
  research for yourself.\n\n- 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.\n- Thirty days has September,
  \ \nApril, June and November.  \nAll the rest have thirty-one,  \nSaving February
  alone,  \nWhich has twenty-eight, rain or shine.  \nAnd on leap years, twenty-nine.\n-
  A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless
  it is divisible by 400.\n\nHow many Sundays fell on the first of the month during
  the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?\n\n"
