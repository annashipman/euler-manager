:content: "Take the number 192 and multiply it by each of 1, 2, and 3:\n\n> 192 ×
  1 = 192  \n> 192 × 2 = 384  \n> 192 × 3 = 576\n\nBy concatenating each product we
  get the 1 to 9 pandigital, 192384576. We will call 192384576 the concatenated product
  of 192 and (1,2,3)\n\nThe same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying
  by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, giving the pandigital, 918273645, which is the concatenated
  product of 9 and (1,2,3,4,5).\n\nWhat is the largest 1 to 9 pandigital 9-digit number
  that can be formed as the concatenated product of an integer with (1,2, ... , <var>n</var>)
  where <var>n</var> \\> 1?\n\n"
