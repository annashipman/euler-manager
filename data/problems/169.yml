  powers of 2

:content: "Define f(0)=1 and f(<var>n</var>) to be the number of different ways <var>n</var>
  can be expressed as a sum of integer powers of 2 using each power no more than twice.\n\nFor
  example, f(10)=5 since there are five different ways to express 10:\n\n1 + 1 + 8
  \ \n1 + 1 + 4 + 4  \n1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4  \n2 + 4 + 4  \n2 + 8\n\nWhat is f(10<sup>25</sup>)?\n\n"
