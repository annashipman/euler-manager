:content: "If we take 47, reverse and add, 47 + 74 = 121, which is palindromic.\n\nNot
  all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,\n\n349 + 943 = 1292,  \n1292
  + 2921 = 4213  \n4213 + 3124 = 7337\n\nThat is, 349 took three iterations to arrive
  at a palindrome.\n\nAlthough no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers,
  like 196, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a palindrome through
  the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel number. Due to the theoretical nature
  of these numbers, and for the purpose of this problem, we shall assume that a number
  is Lychrel until proven otherwise. In addition you are given that for every number
  below ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty iterations,
  or, (ii) no one, with all the computing power that exists, has managed so far to
  map it to a palindrome. In fact, 10677 is the first number to be shown to require
  over fifty iterations before producing a palindrome: 4668731596684224866951378664
  (53 iterations, 28-digits).\n\nSurprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that
  are themselves Lychrel numbers; the first example is 4994.\n\nHow many Lychrel numbers
  are there below ten-thousand?\n\nNOTE: Wording was modified slightly on 24 April
  2007 to emphasise the theoretical nature of Lychrel numbers.\n\n"
