:content: "For a number written in Roman numerals to be considered valid there are
  basic rules which must be followed. Even though the rules allow some numbers to
  be expressed in more than one way there is always a \"best\" way of writing a particular
  number.\n\nFor example, it would appear that there are at least six ways of writing
  the number sixteen:\n\nIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII  \nVIIIIIIIIIII  \nVVIIIIII  \nXIIIIII  \nVVVI
  \ \nXVI\n\nHowever, according to the rules only XIIIIII and XVI are valid, and the
  last example is considered to be the most efficient, as it uses the least number
  of numerals.\n\nThe 11K text file, [roman.txt](project/resources/p089_roman.txt)
  (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), contains one thousand numbers written
  in valid, but not necessarily minimal, Roman numerals; see [About... Roman Numerals](about=roman_numerals)
  for the definitive rules for this problem.\n\nFind the number of characters saved
  by writing each of these in their minimal form.\n\nNote: You can assume that all
  the Roman numerals in the file contain no more than four consecutive identical units.\n\n"
