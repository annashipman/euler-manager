  Let p(_n_) represent the number of different ways in which _n_ coins can be separated into piles. For example, five coins can be separated into piles in exactly seven different ways, so p(5)=7.

  | OO&nbsp; &nbsp;O&nbsp; &nbsp;O&nbsp; &nbsp;O |
  | O&nbsp; &nbsp;O&nbsp; &nbsp;O&nbsp; &nbsp;O&nbsp; &nbsp;O |

  Find the least value of _n_ for which p(_n_) is divisible by one million.
