:content: "The smallest number expressible as the sum of a prime square, prime cube,
  and prime fourth power is 28. In fact, there are exactly four numbers below fifty
  that can be expressed in such a way:\n\n28 = 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup>
  \ \n33 = 3<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup>  \n49 = 5<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup>
  + 2<sup>4</sup>  \n47 = 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup>\n\nHow many
  numbers below fifty million can be expressed as the sum of a prime square, prime
  cube, and prime fourth power?\n\n"
