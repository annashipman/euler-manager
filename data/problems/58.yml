:content: "Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square
  spiral with side length 7 is formed.\n\n**37** 36 35 34 33 32 **31**  \n38 **17**
  16 15 14 **13** 30  \n39 18 &nbsp; **5** &nbsp;4 &nbsp; **3** 12 29  \n40 19 &nbsp;6
  &nbsp;1 &nbsp;2 11 28  \n41 20 &nbsp; **7** &nbsp;8 &nbsp;9 10 27  \n42 21 22 23
  24 25 26  \n**43** 44 45 46 47 48 49\n\nIt is interesting to note that the odd squares
  lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out
  of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13
  â‰ˆ 62%.\n\nIf one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square
  spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is
  the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals
  first falls below 10%?\n\n"
