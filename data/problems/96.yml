:content: "Su Doku (Japanese meaning _number place_) is the name given to a popular
  puzzle concept. Its origin is unclear, but credit must be attributed to Leonhard
  Euler who invented a similar, and much more difficult, puzzle idea called Latin
  Squares. The objective of Su Doku puzzles, however, is to replace the blanks (or
  zeros) in a 9 by 9 grid in such that each row, column, and 3 by 3 box contains each
  of the digits 1 to 9. Below is an example of a typical starting puzzle grid and
  its solution grid.\n\n| \n\n| 0 0 3  \n9 0 0  \n0 0 1 | 0 2 0  \n3 0 5  \n8 0 6
  | 6 0 0  \n0 0 1  \n4 0 0 |\n| 0 0 8  \n7 0 0  \n0 0 6 | 1 0 2  \n0 0 0  \n7 0 8
  | 9 0 0  \n0 0 8  \n2 0 0 |\n| 0 0 2  \n8 0 0  \n0 0 5 | 6 0 9  \n2 0 3  \n0 1 0
  | 5 0 0  \n0 0 9  \n3 0 0 |\n\n | ![]({{ images_dir }}/spacer.gif)  \n | \n\n| 4
  8 3  \n9 6 7  \n2 5 1 | 9 2 1  \n3 4 5  \n8 7 6 | 6 5 7  \n8 2 1  \n4 9 3 |\n| 5
  4 8  \n7 2 9  \n1 3 6 | 1 3 2  \n5 6 4  \n7 9 8 | 9 7 6  \n1 3 8  \n2 4 5 |\n| 3
  7 2  \n8 1 4  \n6 9 5 | 6 8 9  \n2 5 3  \n4 1 7 | 5 1 4  \n7 6 9  \n3 8 2 |\n\n
  |\n\nA well constructed Su Doku puzzle has a unique solution and can be solved by
  logic, although it may be necessary to employ \"guess and test\" methods in order
  to eliminate options (there is much contested opinion over this). The complexity
  of the search determines the difficulty of the puzzle; the example above is considered
  _easy_ because it can be solved by straight forward direct deduction.\n\nThe 6K
  text file, [sudoku.txt](project/resources/p096_sudoku.txt) (right click and 'Save
  Link/Target As...'), contains fifty different Su Doku puzzles ranging in difficulty,
  but all with unique solutions (the first puzzle in the file is the example above).\n\nBy
  solving all fifty puzzles find the sum of the 3-digit numbers found in the top left
  corner of each solution grid; for example, 483 is the 3-digit number found in the
  top left corner of the solution grid above.\n\n"
