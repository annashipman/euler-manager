:content: "An m×n maze is an m×n rectangular grid with walls placed between grid cells
  such that there is exactly one path from the top-left square to any other square.
  \  \nThe following are examples of a 9×12 maze and a 15×20 maze:\n\n![p380_mazes.gif]({{
  images_dir }}/p380_mazes.gif)\n\nLet C(m,n) be the number of distinct m×n mazes.
  Mazes which can be formed by rotation and reflection from another maze are considered
  distinct.\n\nIt can be verified that C(1,1) = 1, C(2,2) = 4, C(3,4) = 2415, and
  C(9,12) = 2.5720e46 (in scientific notation rounded to 5 significant digits).  \nFind
  C(100,500) and write your answer in scientific notation rounded to 5 significant
  digits.\n\nWhen giving your answer, use a lowercase e to separate mantissa and exponent.
  E.g. if the answer is 1234567891011 then the answer format would be 1.2346e12.\n\n"
