:content: "Consider the number 142857. We can right-rotate this number by moving the
  last digit (7) to the front of it, giving us 714285.  \nIt can be verified that
  714285=5Ã—142857.  \nThis demonstrates an unusual property of 142857: it is a divisor
  of its right-rotation.\n\nFind the last 5 digits of the sum of all integers <var>n</var>,
  10 \\< <var>n</var> \\< 10<sup>100</sup>, that have this property.\n\n"
