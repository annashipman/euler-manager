:content: "A Hamming number is a positive number which has no prime factor larger
  than 5.  \nSo the first few Hamming numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12,
  15.  \nThere are 1105 Hamming numbers not exceeding 10<sup>8</sup>.\n\nWe will call
  a positive number a generalised Hamming number of type <var>n</var>, if it has no
  prime factor larger than <var>n</var>.  \nHence the Hamming numbers are the generalised
  Hamming numbers of type 5.\n\nHow many generalised Hamming numbers of type 100 are
  there which don't exceed 10<sup>9</sup>?\n\n"
