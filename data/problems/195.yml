:content: "Let's call an integer sided triangle with exactly one angle of 60 degrees
  a 60-degree triangle.  \nLet <var>r</var> be the radius of the inscribed circle
  of such a 60-degree triangle.\n\nThere are 1234 60-degree triangles for which <var>r</var>
  ≤ 100.  \nLet T(<var>n</var>) be the number of 60-degree triangles for which <var>r</var>
  ≤ <var>n</var>, so  \n T(100) = 1234,&nbsp; T(1000) = 22767, and&nbsp; T(10000)
  = 359912.\n\nFind T(1053779).\n\n"
