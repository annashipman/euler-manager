:content: "By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers
  on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.\n\n**3**  \n**7**
  4  \n2 **4** 6  \n8 5 **9** 3\n\nThat is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.\n\nFind the maximum
  total from top to bottom in [triangle.txt](project/resources/p067_triangle.txt)
  (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 15K text file containing a triangle
  with one-hundred rows.\n\n**NOTE:** This is a much more difficult version of [Problem
  18](problem=18). It is not possible to try every route to solve this problem, as
  there are 2<sup>99</sup> altogether! If you could check one trillion (10<sup>12</sup>)
  routes every second it would take over twenty billion years to check them all. There
  is an efficient algorithm to solve it. ;o)\n\n"
