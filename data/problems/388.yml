:content: "Consider all lattice points (a,b,c) with 0 ≤ a,b,c ≤ N.\n\nFrom the origin
  O(0,0,0) all lines are drawn to the other lattice points.  \nLet D(N) be the number
  of _distinct_ such lines.\n\nYou are given that D(1 000 000) = 831909254469114121.\n\nFind
  D(10<sup>10</sup>). Give as your answer the first nine digits followed by the last
  nine digits.\n\n"
