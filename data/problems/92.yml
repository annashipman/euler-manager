:content: "A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits
  in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.\n\nFor example,\n\n44
  → 32 → 13 → 10 → **1** → **1**  \n85 → **89** → 145 → 42 → 20 → 4 → 16 → 37 → 58
  → **89**\n\nTherefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an
  endless loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually
  arrive at 1 or 89.\n\nHow many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at
  89?\n\n"
