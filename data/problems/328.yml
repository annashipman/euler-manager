:content: "We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers
  {1, 2, ..., <var>n</var>} by asking questions. Each number (question) we ask, has
  a <u>cost equal to the number asked</u> and we get one of three possible answers:\n\n-
  \"Your guess is lower than the hidden number\", or\n- \"Yes, that's it!\", or\n-
  \"Your guess is higher than the hidden number\".\n\nGiven the value of <var>n</var>,
  an _optimal strategy_ minimizes the total cost (i.e. the sum of all the questions
  asked) <u>for the worst possible case</u>. E.g.\n\nIf <var>n</var>=3, the best we
  can do is obviously to ask the number \" **2**\". The answer will immediately lead
  us to find the hidden number (at a total cost = 2).\n\nIf <var>n</var>=8, we might
  decide to use a \"binary search\" type of strategy: Our first question would be
  \" **4**\" and if the hidden number is higher than 4 we will need one or two additional
  questions.  \nLet our second question be \" **6**\". If the hidden number is still
  higher than 6, we will need a third question in order to discriminate between 7
  and 8.  \nThus, our third question will be \" **7**\" and the total cost for this
  worst-case scenario will be 4+6+7= **17**.\n\nWe can improve considerably the worst-case
  cost for <var>n</var>=8, by asking \" **5**\" as our first question.  \nIf we are
  told that the hidden number is higher than 5, our second question will be \" **7**\",
  then we'll know for certain what the hidden number is (for a total cost of 5+7=
  **12** ).  \nIf we are told that the hidden number is lower than 5, our second question
  will be \" **3**\" and if the hidden number is lower than 3 our third question will
  be \" **1**\", giving a total cost of 5+3+1= **9**.  \nSince **12** \\> **9** ,
  the worst-case cost for this strategy is **12**. That's better than what we achieved
  previously with the \"binary search\" strategy; it is also better than or equal
  to any other strategy.  \nSo, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy
  for <var>n</var>=8.\n\nLet C(<var>n</var>) be the worst-case cost achieved by an
  optimal strategy for <var>n</var>, as described above.  \nThus C(1) = 0, C(2) =
  1, C(3) = 2 and C(8) = 12.  \nSimilarly, C(100) = 400 and ![p328_sum1.gif]({{ images_dir
  }}/p328_sum1.gif)C(<var>n</var>) = 17575.\n\nFind ![p328_sum2.gif]({{ images_dir
  }}/p328_sum2.gif)C(<var>n</var>).\n\n"
