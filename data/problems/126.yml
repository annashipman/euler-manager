:content: "The minimum number of cubes to cover every visible face on a cuboid measuring
  3&nbsp;x&nbsp;2&nbsp;x&nbsp;1 is twenty-two.\n\n ![]({{ images_dir }}/p126.gif)
  \ \n\nIf we then add a second layer to this solid it would require forty-six cubes
  to cover every visible face, the third layer would require seventy-eight cubes,
  and the fourth layer would require one-hundred and eighteen cubes to cover every
  visible face.\n\nHowever, the first layer on a cuboid measuring 5&nbsp;x&nbsp;1&nbsp;x&nbsp;1
  also requires twenty-two cubes; similarly the first layer on cuboids measuring 5&nbsp;x&nbsp;3&nbsp;x&nbsp;1,
  7&nbsp;x&nbsp;2&nbsp;x&nbsp;1, and 11&nbsp;x&nbsp;1&nbsp;x&nbsp;1 all contain forty-six
  cubes.\n\nWe shall define C(_n_) to represent the number of cuboids that contain
  _n_ cubes in one of its layers. So C(22) = 2, C(46) = 4, C(78) = 5, and C(118) =
  8.\n\nIt turns out that 154 is the least value of _n_ for which C(_n_) = 10.\n\nFind
  the least value of _n_ for which C(_n_) = 1000.\n\n"
