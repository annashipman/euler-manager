  neighbours in the triangle.\n\nA set of three primes is called a _prime triplet_
  if one of the three primes has the other two as neighbours in the triangle.\n\nFor
  example, in the second row, the prime numbers 2 and 3 are elements of some prime
  triplet.\n\nIf row 8 is considered, it contains two primes which are elements of
  some prime triplet, i.e. 29 and 31.  \nIf row 9 is considered, it contains only
  one prime which is an element of some prime triplet: 37.\n\nDefine S(<var>n</var>)
  as the sum of the primes in row <var>n</var> which are elements of any prime triplet.
  \ \nThen S(8)=60 and S(9)=37.\n\nYou are given that S(10000)=950007619.\n\nFind
  &nbsp;S(5678027) + S(7208785).\n\n"
