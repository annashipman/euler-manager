:content: "It turns out that 12 cm is the smallest length of wire that can be bent
  to form an integer sided right angle triangle in exactly one way, but there are
  many more examples.\n\n**12 cm** : (3,4,5)  \n**24 cm** : (6,8,10)  \n**30 cm**
  : (5,12,13)  \n**36 cm** : (9,12,15)  \n**40 cm** : (8,15,17)  \n**48 cm** : (12,16,20)\n\nIn
  contrast, some lengths of wire, like 20 cm, cannot be bent to form an integer sided
  right angle triangle, and other lengths allow more than one solution to be found;
  for example, using 120 cm it is possible to form exactly three different integer
  sided right angle triangles.\n\n**120 cm** : (30,40,50), (20,48,52), (24,45,51)\n\nGiven
  that L is the length of the wire, for how many values of L â‰¤ 1,500,000 can exactly
  one integer sided right angle triangle be formed?\n\n"
