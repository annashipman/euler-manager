  A composite is a number containing at least two prime factors. For example, 15 = 3 × 5; 9 = 3 × 3; 12 = 2 × 2 × 3.

  There are ten composites below thirty containing precisely two, not necessarily distinct, prime factors: 4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 25, 26.

  How many composite integers, <var>n</var> \< 10<sup>8</sup>, have precisely two, not necessarily distinct, prime factors?
