:content: "A 4x4 grid is filled with digits d, 0 ≤ d ≤ 9.\n\nIt can be seen that in
  the grid\n\n6 3 3 0  \n5 0 4 3  \n0 7 1 4  \n1 2 4 5\n\nthe sum of each row and
  each column has the value 12. Moreover the sum of each diagonal is also 12.\n\nIn
  how many ways can you fill a 4x4 grid with the digits d, 0 ≤ d ≤ 9 so that each
  row, each column, and both diagonals have the same sum?\n\n"
