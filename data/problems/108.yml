:content: "In the following equation <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, and <var>n</var>
  are positive integers.\n\n| \n1  \n<var>x</var>\n | + | \n1  \n<var>y</var>\n |

  exceeds one-thousand?\n\nNOTE: This problem is an easier version of [Problem 110](problem=110);
  it is strongly advised that you solve this one first.\n\n"
