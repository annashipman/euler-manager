:content: "Tatami are rectangular mats, used to completely cover the floor of a room,
  without overlap.\n\nAssuming that the only type of available tatami has dimensions
  1×2, there are obviously some limitations for the shape and size of the rooms that
  can be covered.\n\nFor this problem, we consider only rectangular rooms with integer
  dimensions <var>a</var>, <var>b</var> and even size <var>s</var> = <var>a</var>·<var>b</var>.
  \ \nWe use the term 'size' to denote the floor surface area of the room, and — without
  loss of generality — we add the condition <var>a</var> ≤ <var>b</var>.\n\nThere
  is one rule to follow when laying out tatami: there must be no points where corners
  of four different mats meet.  \nFor example, consider the two arrangements below
  for a 4×4 room:\n\n ![p256_tatami3.gif]({{ images_dir }}/p256_tatami3.gif)  \n\nThe
  arrangement on the left is acceptable, whereas the one on the right is not: a red
  \" **X**\" in the middle, marks the point where four tatami meet.\n\nBecause of
  this rule, certain even-sized rooms cannot be covered with tatami: we call them
  tatami-free rooms.  \nFurther, we define <var>T</var>(<var>s</var>) as the number
  of tatami-free rooms of size <var>s</var>.\n\nThe smallest tatami-free room has
  size <var>s</var> = 70 and dimensions 7×10.  \nAll the other rooms of size <var>s</var>
  = 70 can be covered with tatami; they are: 1×70, 2×35 and 5×14.  \nHence, <var>T</var>(70)
  = 1.\n\nSimilarly, we can verify that <var>T</var>(1320) = 5 because there are exactly
  5 tatami-free rooms of size <var>s</var> = 1320:  \n20×66, 22×60, 24×55, 30×44 and
  33×40.  \nIn fact, <var>s</var> = 1320 is the smallest room-size <var>s</var> for
  which <var>T</var>(<var>s</var>) = 5.\n\nFind the smallest room-size <var>s</var>
  for which <var>T</var>(<var>s</var>) = 200.\n\n"
