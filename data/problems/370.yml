  Let us define a _geometric triangle_ as an integer sided triangle with sides <var>a</var> ≤ <var>b</var> ≤ <var>c</var> so that its sides form a **geometric progression** , i.e. <var>b<sup>2</sup></var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<var>a</var>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<var>c</var>&nbsp;.&nbsp;

  An example of such a geometric triangle is the triangle with sides <var>a</var> = 144, <var>b</var> = 156 and <var>c</var> = 169.

  There are 861805 geometric triangles with perimeter ≤ 10<sup>6</sup> .

  How many geometric triangles exist with perimeter ≤ 2.5·10<sup>13</sup> ?
