:content: "Consider the triangles with integer sides a, b and c with a ≤ b ≤ c.  \nAn
  integer sided triangle (a,b,c) is called primitive if <dfn title=\"gcd(a,b,c)=gcd(a,gcd(b,c))\">
  gcd(a,b,c)</dfn>=1.   \nHow many primitive integer sided triangles exist with a
  perimeter not exceeding 10 000 000?\n\n"
