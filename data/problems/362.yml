:content: "Consider the number 54.  \n54 can be factored in 7 distinct ways into one
  or more factors larger than 1:  \n54, 2×27, 3×18, 6×9, 3×3×6, 2×3×9 and 2×3×3×3.
  \ \nIf we require that the factors are all squarefree only two ways remain: 3×3×6
  and 2×3×3×3.\n\nLet's call Fsf(<var>n</var>) the number of ways <var>n</var> can
  be factored into one or more squarefree factors larger than 1, so Fsf(54)=2.\n\nLet
  S(<var>n</var>) be ∑Fsf(<var>k</var>) for <var>k</var>=2 to <var>n</var>.\n\nS(100)=193.\n\nFind
  S(10 000 000 000).\n\n"
