:content: "Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:\n\n_x_<sup>2</sup>
  – D_y_<sup>2</sup> = 1\n\nFor example, when D=13, the minimal solution in _x_ is
  649<sup>2</sup> – 13×180<sup>2</sup> = 1.\n\nIt can be assumed that there are no
  solutions in positive integers when D is square.\n\nBy finding minimal solutions
  in _x_ for D = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, we obtain the following:\n\n3<sup>2</sup> – 2×2<sup>2</sup>
  = 1  \n2<sup>2</sup> – 3×1<sup>2</sup> = 1  \n9<sup>2</sup> – 5×4<sup>2</sup> =
  1  \n5<sup>2</sup> – 6×2<sup>2</sup> = 1  \n8<sup>2</sup> – 7×3<sup>2</sup> = 1\n\nHence,
  by considering minimal solutions in _x_ for D ≤ 7, the largest _x_ is obtained when
  D=5.\n\nFind the value of D ≤ 1000 in minimal solutions of _x_ for which the largest
  value of _x_ is obtained.\n\n"
