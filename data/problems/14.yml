:content: "The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:\n\n<var>n</var>
  → <var>n</var>/2 (<var>n</var> is even)  \n<var>n</var> → 3<var>n</var> + 1 (<var>n</var>
  is odd)\n\nUsing the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following
  sequence:\n\n13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1\n\nIt can be seen that this
  sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. Although it has
  not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish
  at 1.\n\nWhich starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?\n\n**NOTE:**
  Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.\n\n"
