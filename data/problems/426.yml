:content: "Consider an infinite row of boxes. Some of the boxes contain a ball. For
  example, an initial configuration of 2 consecutive occupied boxes followed by 2
  empty boxes, 2 occupied boxes, 1 empty box, and 2 occupied boxes can be denoted
  by the sequence (2, 2, 2, 1, 2), in which the number of consecutive occupied and
  empty boxes appear alternately.\n\nA turn consists of moving each ball exactly once
  according to the following rule: Transfer the leftmost ball which has not been moved
  to the nearest empty box to its right.\n\nAfter one turn the sequence (2, 2, 2,
  1, 2) becomes (2, 2, 1, 2, 3) as can be seen below; note that we begin the new sequence
  starting at the first occupied box.\n\n ![p426_baxball1.gif]({{ images_dir }}/p426_baxball1.gif)\n\nA
  system like this is called a **Box-Ball System** or **BBS** for short.\n\nIt can
  be shown that after a sufficient number of turns, the system evolves to a state
  where the consecutive numbers of occupied boxes is invariant. In the example below,
  the consecutive numbers of **occupied boxes** evolves to [1, 2, 3]; we shall call
  this the final state.\n\n ![p426_baxball2.gif]({{ images_dir }}/p426_baxball2.gif)\n\nWe
  define the sequence {<var>t</var><sub><var>i</var></sub>}:\n\n- <var>s</var><sub>0</sub>
  = 290797\n- <var>s</var><sub><var>k</var>+1</sub> = <var>s</var><sub><var>k</var></sub><sup>2</sup>
  mod 50515093\n- <var>t</var><sub><var>k</var></sub> = (<var>s</var><sub><var>k</var></sub>
  mod 64) + 1\n\nStarting from the initial configuration (<var>t</var><sub>0</sub>,
  <var>t</var><sub>1</sub>, …, <var>t</var><sub>10</sub>), the final state becomes
  [1, 3, 10, 24, 51, 75].  \nStarting from the initial configuration (<var>t</var><sub>0</sub>,
  <var>t</var><sub>1</sub>, …, <var>t</var><sub>10 000 000</sub>), find the final
  state.  \nGive as your answer the sum of the squares of the elements of the final
  state. For example, if the final state is [1, 2, 3] then 14 ( = 1<sup>2</sup> +
  2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>) is your answer.\n\n"
