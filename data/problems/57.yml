:content: "It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as
  an infinite continued fraction.\n\nâˆš 2 = 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + ... ))) = 1.414213...\n\nBy
  expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:\n\n1 + 1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5  \n1
  + 1/(2 + 1/2) = 7/5 = 1.4  \n1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2)) = 17/12 = 1.41666...  \n1 +
  1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2))) = 41/29 = 1.41379...\n\nThe next three expansions are
  99/70, 239/169, and 577/408, but the eighth expansion, 1393/985, is the first example
  where the number of digits in the numerator exceeds the number of digits in the
  denominator.\n\nIn the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain
  a numerator with more digits than denominator?\n\n"
