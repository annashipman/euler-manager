:content: "Alice and Bob play the game Nim Square.  \nNim Square is just like ordinary
  three-heap normal play Nim, but the players may only remove a square number of stones
  from a heap.  \nThe number of stones in the three heaps is represented by the ordered
  triple (a,b,c).  \nIf 0≤a≤b≤c≤29 then the number of losing positions for the next
  player is 1160.\n\nFind the number of losing positions for the next player if 0≤a≤b≤c≤100
  000.\n\n"
