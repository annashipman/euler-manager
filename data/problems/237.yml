  Let T(_n_) be the number of tours over a 4 × _n_ playing board such that:

  - The tour starts in the top left corner.
  - The tour consists of moves that are up, down, left, or right one square.
  - The tour visits each square exactly once.
  - The tour ends in the bottom left corner.

  The diagram shows one tour over a 4 × 10 board:

  T(10) is 2329. What is T(10<sup>12</sup>) modulo 10<sup>8</sup>?
