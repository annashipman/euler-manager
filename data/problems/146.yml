  The smallest positive integer _n_ for which the numbers _n_<sup>2</sup>+1, _n_<sup>2</sup>+3, _n_<sup>2</sup>+7, _n_<sup>2</sup>+9, _n_<sup>2</sup>+13, and _n_<sup>2</sup>+27 are consecutive primes is 10. The sum of all such integers _n_ below one-million is 1242490.

  What is the sum of all such integers _n_ below 150 million?
