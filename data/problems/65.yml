  √2 = 1 + | \n1\n |\n| &nbsp; | 2 + | \n1\n |\n| &nbsp; | &nbsp; | 2 + | \n1\n |\n|
  &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | 2 + | \n1\n |\n| &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
  2 + ... |\n\nThe infinite continued fraction can be written, √2 = [1;(2)], (2) indicates
  that 2 repeats _ad infinitum_. In a similar way, √23 = [4;(1,3,1,8)].\n\nIt turns
  out that the sequence of partial values of continued fractions for square roots
  provide the best rational approximations. Let us consider the convergents for √2.\n\n|
  1 + | \n1\n | = 3/2 |\n| &nbsp; | \n2\n | &nbsp; |\n\n| 1 + | \n1\n | = 7/5 |\n|
  &nbsp; | 2 + | \n1\n |\n| &nbsp; | &nbsp; | \n2\n | &nbsp; |\n\n| 1 + | \n1\n |
  = 17/12 |\n| &nbsp; | 2 + | \n1\n | &nbsp; |\n| &nbsp; | &nbsp; | 2 + | \n1\n |
  &nbsp; |\n| &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | \n2\n | &nbsp; |\n\n| 1 + | \n1\n | = 41/29
  |\n| &nbsp; | 2 + | \n1\n |\n| &nbsp; | &nbsp; | 2 + | \n1\n | &nbsp; |\n| &nbsp;
  | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | 2 + | \n1\n | &nbsp; |\n| &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp;
  | \n2\n | &nbsp; |\n\nHence the sequence of the first ten convergents for √2 are:\n\n1,
  3/2, 7/5, 17/12, 41/29, 99/70, 239/169, 577/408, 1393/985, 3363/2378, ...\n\nWhat
  is most surprising is that the important mathematical constant,  \n_e_ = [2; 1,2,1,
  1,4,1, 1,6,1 , ... , 1,2_k_,1, ...].\n\nThe first ten terms in the sequence of convergents
  for _e_ are:\n\n2, 3, 8/3, 11/4, 19/7, 87/32, 106/39, 193/71, 1264/465, 1457/536,
  ...\n\nThe sum of digits in the numerator of the 10<sup>th</sup> convergent is 1+4+5+7=17.\n\nFind
  the sum of digits in the numerator of the 100<sup>th</sup> convergent of the continued
  fraction for _e_.\n\n"
