:content: "Consider the right angled triangle with sides a=7, b=24 and c=25. The area
  of this triangle is 84, which is divisible by the perfect numbers 6 and 28.  \nMoreover
  it is a primitive right angled triangle as gcd(a,b)=1 and gcd(b,c)=1.  \nAlso c
  is a perfect square.\n\nWe will call a right angled triangle perfect if  \n-it is
  a primitive right angled triangle  \n-its hypotenuse is a perfect square\n\nWe will
  call a right angled triangle super-perfect if  \n-it is a perfect right angled triangle
  and  \n-its area is a multiple of the perfect numbers 6 and 28.\n\nHow many perfect
  right-angled triangles with câ‰¤10<sup>16</sup> exist that are not super-perfect?\n\n"
