:content: "An even positive integer N will be called admissible, if it is a power
  of 2 or its distinct prime factors are consecutive primes.  \nThe first twelve admissible
  numbers are 2,4,6,8,12,16,18,24,30,32,36,48.\n\nIf N is admissible, the smallest
  integer M \\> 1 such that N+M is prime, will be called the pseudo-Fortunate number
  for N.\n\nFor example, N=630 is admissible since it is even and its distinct prime
  factors are the consecutive primes 2,3,5 and 7.  \n The next prime number after
  631 is 641; hence, the pseudo-Fortunate number for 630 is M=11.  \nIt can also be
  seen that the pseudo-Fortunate number for 16 is 3.\n\nFind the sum of all distinct
  pseudo-Fortunate numbers for admissible numbers N less than 10<sup>9</sup>.\n\n"
