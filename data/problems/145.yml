  Some positive integers _n_ have the property that the sum [_n_ + reverse(_n_)] consists entirely of odd (decimal) digits. For instance, 36 + 63 = 99 and 409 + 904 = 1313. We will call such numbers _reversible_; so 36, 63, 409, and 904 are reversible. Leading zeroes are not allowed in either _n_ or reverse(_n_).

  There are 120 reversible numbers below one-thousand.

  How many reversible numbers are there below one-billion (10<sup>9</sup>)?
