  a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:\n\n**21** 22 23 24 **25**  \n20 &nbsp; **7**
  &nbsp;8 &nbsp; **9** 10  \n19 &nbsp;6 &nbsp; **1** &nbsp;2 11  \n18 &nbsp; **5**
  &nbsp;4 &nbsp; **3** 12  \n**17** 16 15 14 **13**\n\nIt can be verified that the
  sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.\n\nWhat is the sum of the numbers on
  the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?\n\n"
