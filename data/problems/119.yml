  The number 512 is interesting because it is equal to the sum of its digits raised to some power: 5 + 1 + 2 = 8, and 8<sup>3</sup> = 512. Another example of a number with this property is 614656 = 28<sup>4</sup>.

  We shall define _a_<sub>n</sub> to be the _n_th term of this sequence and insist that a number must contain at least two digits to have a sum.

  You are given that _a_<sub>2</sub> = 512 and _a_<sub>10</sub> = 614656.

  Find _a_<sub>30</sub>.
