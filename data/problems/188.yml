:content: "The hyperexponentiation or tetration of a number a by a positive integer
  b, denoted by a↑↑b or <sup>b</sup>a, is recursively defined by:  \n  \na↑↑1 = a,
  \ \na↑↑(k+1) = a<sup>(a↑↑k)</sup>.\n\nThus we have e.g. 3↑↑2 = 3<sup>3</sup> = 27,
  hence 3↑↑3 = 3<sup>27</sup> = 7625597484987 and 3↑↑4 is roughly 10<sup>3.6383346400240996*10^12</sup>.\n\nFind
  the last 8 digits of 1777↑↑1855.\n\n"
