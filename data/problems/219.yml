:content: "Let A and B be bit strings (sequences of 0's and 1's).  \nIf A is equal
  to the leftmost length(A) bits of B, then A is said to be a prefix of B.  \nFor
  example, 00110 is a prefix of 001101001, but not of 00111 or 100110.\n\nA prefix-free
  code of size <var>n</var> is a collection of <var>n</var> distinct bit strings such
  that no string is a prefix of any other. For example, this is a prefix-free code
  of size 6:\n\n0000, 0001, 001, 01, 10, 11\n\nNow suppose that it costs one penny
  to transmit a '0' bit, but four pence to transmit a '1'.  \nThen the total cost
  of the prefix-free code shown above is 35 pence, which happens to be the cheapest
  possible for the skewed pricing scheme in question.  \nIn short, we write Cost(6)
  = 35.\n\nWhat is Cost(10<sup>9</sup>) ?\n\n"
