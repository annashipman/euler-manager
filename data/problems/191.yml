:content: "A particular school offers cash rewards to children with good attendance
  and punctuality. If they are absent for three consecutive days or late on more than
  one occasion then they forfeit their prize.\n\nDuring an n-day period a trinary
  string is formed for each child consisting of L's (late), O's (on time), and A's
  (absent).\n\nAlthough there are eighty-one trinary strings for a 4-day period that
  can be formed, exactly forty-three strings would lead to a prize:\n\nOOOO OOOA OOOL
  OOAO OOAA OOAL OOLO OOLA OAOO OAOA  \nOAOL OAAO OAAL OALO OALA OLOO OLOA OLAO OLAA
  AOOO  \nAOOA AOOL AOAO AOAA AOAL AOLO AOLA AAOO AAOA AAOL  \nAALO AALA ALOO ALOA
  ALAO ALAA LOOO LOOA LOAO LOAA  \nLAOO LAOA LAAO\n\nHow many \"prize\" strings exist
  over a 30-day period?\n\n"
