:content: "The **look and say** sequence goes 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211, 13112221,
  1113213211, ...  \nThe sequence starts with 1 and all other members are obtained
  by describing the previous member in terms of consecutive digits.  \nIt helps to
  do this out loud:  \n1 is 'one one' → 11  \n11 is 'two ones' → 21  \n21 is 'one
  two and one one' → 1211   \n1211 is 'one one, one two and two ones' → 111221  \n111221
  is 'three ones, two twos and one one' → 312211  \n...\n\nDefine A(n), B(n) and C(n)
  as the number of ones, twos and threes in the n'th element of the sequence respectively.
  \ \nOne can verify that A(40) = 31254, B(40) = 20259 and C(40) = 11625.\n\nFind
  A(n), B(n) and C(n) for n = 10<sup>12</sup>.  \n Give your answer modulo 2<sup>30</sup>
  and separate your values for A, B and C by a comma.  \n E.g. for n = 40 the answer
  would be 31254,20259,11625\n\n"
