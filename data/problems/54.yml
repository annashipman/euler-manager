:content: "In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards and are ranked, from
  lowest to highest, in the following way:\n\n- **High Card** : Highest value card.\n-
  **One Pair** : Two cards of the same value.\n- **Two Pairs** : Two different pairs.\n-
  **Three of a Kind** : Three cards of the same value.\n- **Straight** : All cards
  are consecutive values.\n- **Flush** : All cards of the same suit.\n- **Full House**
  : Three of a kind and a pair.\n- **Four of a Kind** : Four cards of the same value.\n-
  **Straight Flush** : All cards are consecutive values of same suit.\n- **Royal Flush**
  : Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, in same suit.\n\nThe cards are valued in the order:
  \ \n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.\n\nIf two players have the
  same ranked hands then the rank made up of the highest value wins; for example,
  a pair of eights beats a pair of fives (see example 1 below). But if two ranks tie,
  for example, both players have a pair of queens, then highest cards in each hand
  are compared (see example 4 below); if the highest cards tie then the next highest
  cards are compared, and so on.\n\nConsider the following five hands dealt to two
  players:\n\n| **Hand** | &nbsp; | **Player 1** | &nbsp; | **Player 2** | &nbsp;
  | **Winner** |\n| **1** | &nbsp; | 5H 5C 6S 7S KD  \n\nPair of Fives\n | &nbsp;
  | 2C 3S 8S 8D TD  \n\nPair of Eights\n | &nbsp; | Player 2 |\n| **2** | &nbsp; |
  5D 8C 9S JS AC  \n\nHighest card Ace\n | &nbsp; | 2C 5C 7D 8S QH  \n\nHighest card
  Queen\n | &nbsp; | Player 1 |\n| **3** | &nbsp; | 2D 9C AS AH AC  \n\nThree Aces\n
  | &nbsp; | 3D 6D 7D TD QD  \n\nFlush with Diamonds\n | &nbsp; | Player 2 |\n| **4**
  | &nbsp; | 4D 6S 9H QH QC  \n\nPair of Queens  \nHighest card Nine\n | &nbsp; |
  3D 6D 7H QD QS  \n\nPair of Queens  \nHighest card Seven\n | &nbsp; | Player 1 |\n|
  **5** | &nbsp; | 2H 2D 4C 4D 4S  \n\nFull House  \nWith Three Fours\n | &nbsp; |
  3C 3D 3S 9S 9D  \n\nFull House  \nwith Three Threes\n | &nbsp; | Player 1 |\n\nThe
  file, [poker.txt](project/resources/p054_poker.txt), contains one-thousand random
  hands dealt to two players. Each line of the file contains ten cards (separated
  by a single space): the first five are Player 1's cards and the last five are Player
  2's cards. You can assume that all hands are valid (no invalid characters or repeated
  cards), each player's hand is in no specific order, and in each hand there is a
  clear winner.\n\nHow many hands does Player 1 win?\n\n"
