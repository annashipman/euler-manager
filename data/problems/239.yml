:content: "A set of disks numbered 1 through 100 are placed in a line in random order.\n\nWhat
  is the probability that we have a partial derangement such that exactly 22 prime
  number discs are found away from their natural positions?  \n(Any number of non-prime
  disks may also be found in or out of their natural positions.)\n\nGive your answer
  rounded to 12 places behind the decimal point in the form 0.abcdefghijkl.\n\n"
